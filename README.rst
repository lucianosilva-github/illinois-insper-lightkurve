**ILLINOIS-INSPER Lightkurve** is a open-source Python/C++ package which offers a beautiful and user-friendly way
to analyze astronomical flux time series data, in particular the pixels and lightcurves obtained by
**NASA's Kepler and TESS exoplanet missions, with efficiency provided by CharmPy and STAPL**.
